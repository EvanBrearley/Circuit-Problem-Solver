# Circuit-Problem-Solver
This program will determine unknown voltages, currents, node voltages and mesh currents using information about a circuit, with its nodes labelled 0 through n-1 nodes, where n is the number of nodes, and node 0 represents the ground node in nodal analysis. With the implementations of KCL currents are to be detailed in terms of which node they enter and leave, and voltages in KVL should be inputted in terms of which nodes the voltages are being measured across and the one with the higher potential. For Nodal and Mesh Analysis, the type of element matters, with resistors detailed in terms of connected nodes and resistance, while voltage and current sources are detailed similarly but for the inclusion of the node receiving current/ the node with higher potential, and current/voltage replacing resistance. Furthermore, for mesh analysis, the meshes that are to be analysed should be specified in terms of which nodes they contain, with the first node repeated. Finally, the methods of mesh and nodal analysis are functional up to cases where more than one node is attached to multiple sources (voltage in nodal analysis, current in mesh analysis), although, if only one node has multiple voltage sources, labelling this one as the ground (node 0) will allow for proper calculation.
